## GUIDE

This is a local development tool to pair with Webflow
which makes it easier to work with custom JS code in the editor

For now, it does not handle deployment to production - as relies on
a server running on local host to host the files

## IMPORTANT
Do *not* publish the site to main domain, this will cause unexpected issues

It is intended whilst developing ONLY and to be used in .webflow.io domain

## How to use
Your custom code will be written in the 'app.js' file ONLY
Feel free to back up code once you're happy into pages folder

run `npm start` or `bun start` to run local server

in webflow: rather than coding inside the editor, paste the following script tag in during development:

```
<!-- [Local Development via Parcel.js] -->
<script src="http://localhost:1234/app.js"></script>
```

Code away! You no longer need to re-publish the site every time you make changes to your script. Now, just reload the .webflow.io site and see your changes.

When you're happy -- copy the contents of the app.js file into your webflow `<body/>` tag and remove the local script.

Remember to wrap the pasted contents in a `<script>[...]</script>` for this to work
